# Process-scheduling-algorithms-implementation

This project helps for better understanding of Process scheduling algorithms namely FCFS, SJF, SRTF, PRIORITY and ROUND ROBIN scheduling algorithms.

CONTRIBUTORS:-

 1. TUSHAR CHAMOLI (UPES, DEHRADUN)
 2. SMRITI CHAUDHURY (UPES, DEHRADUN)
 3. VAIBHAV KAUSHIK (UPES, DEHARDUN)

Use the menu.c file and compile it.
STEP 1. Enter your required sceduling algorithm.

STEP 2. Enter the required number of processes.

STEP 3. Enter the BURST TIME and the ARRIVAL TIME for each process.

STEP 4. Hit Enter

You will find the Avg. waiting time, Avg. Turn arounf time and Gantt chart representation of the processes according to the process scheduling algorithms associated with it. 

NOTE- This project uses Linked List and Heaps data structures.

YOU CAN FIND ATTACHED SCREENSHOT FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING.
